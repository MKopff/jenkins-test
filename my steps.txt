Accessing the Docker container in jenkins:
https://www.infoworld.com/article/3637829/continuous-integration-with-docker-and-jenkins.html#:~:text=Go%20to%20Manage%20Jenkins%20%2D%3E%20Plugins,Configure%20Clouds%20on%20the%20left.

Add the Docker plug-in
There are several Docker plug-ins available. We’ll use the one imaginatively named “Docker plugin,” which gives you a lot of power with minimum configuration. For more detailed control, you might consider the docker-build-step plug-in, or switching to a pipeline build.
Go to Manage Jenkins -> Plugins -> Available and type “docker” into the field. Select “Docker plugin” and install it.
Jenkins refers to the Docker plugin as a “cloud.” Click Manage Jenkins once again, and now click the Manage Clouds and Nodes button in the middle. Now click Configure Clouds on the left.
This will allow you to access the bridge network you created earlier and connect to the container running Docker.
For the name, use something you’ll recognize like “Docker.” Click Docker Cloud Details to expose the Docker Host URI field, and enter “tcp://docker:2375” there.
Save it and return to the Jenkins dashboard.
