whenever I run an existing container again (I closed previous one and then tried to run it again) I see that before executing tests maven downloads all the dependencies again.
I think that happens because I didn't include the downloading dependencies step in the dockerfile.
Trying to read this: https://nieldw.medium.com/caching-maven-dependencies-in-a-docker-build-dca6ca7ad612
- solved by adding the "RUN mvn package" command at the end of the dockerfile

To update the source code of an app in the existing container i just re-build it (docker rebuilds only the code base since everything else hasn't change)

Working with docker via Jenkins
- check if the container exists
- if not, run it
- if yes - execute the commands (tests)



docker run -it prototype - creates a new container every time.
How to launch the same one when it's needed?
